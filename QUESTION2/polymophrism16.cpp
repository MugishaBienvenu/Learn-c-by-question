// 3.16 Suppose that we want a class that can be used to represent people at a university (e.g., faculty, staff, undergrad
//     uate students, and graduate students). For all types of people, we want to record their name and university ID.
//      For specific types of people, we want to record some additional information. In the case of faculty, we want to
//      record their rank (i.e., Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Full Professor). In the case of undergraduate
//      students, we want to record their year of study (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 4). In the case of graduate students, we want
//      to record their supervisorâ€™s university ID. Suggest a class hierarchy that might be used to represent the above
//      collection of people. You do not need to fully implement the class.
